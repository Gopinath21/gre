Why Managment targeted my health indirectly?

I got odd shift roster offenly . For eg ,7 days,
I have a improver roster as like In a week I got 2 days night 2 after nood 2 days moring ,3 are night as followed.

I need upcoming 30 days eathougher morning or after should not night b/c
    You well now I used sleeping tablets for 10days to sleep which is suggested by the docotor , b/c of my eyes got dammaged (12 hours shift more than 2 months & 3 LED T.V's & 3 monitors not proper sleep  )
 I used again 10 days b/c of odd roster as show above to sleep.It means I used 2odays , It is not good for me to continue  
So  I should stop  sleeping pills & need to be monitor for 30day to recover my health recover( it means need to get natual sleep & continue ) ..

I hope you are understoop my problem . I kinldy requsting you to provide upcoming 30 only morning or after noon. So night.
